You can usually complete an auto title loan in an hour or two. These loans are available to owners who owe no money on their vehicles.

A title loan lender usually won’t perform a credit check since the car’s title collateralizes the loan. These loans typically charge a monthly finance fee of 25%, which equals a 300% APR.

Most title loans lend 25% to 50% of your car’s resale value. You can usually borrow from $100 to $5,500, although some loans may exceed $10,000. The loan amount depends on the vehicle’s current value and what you can afford to borrow.

Title loans are more than expensive — they’re risky too. When you take a title loan, the lender places a lien on your vehicle. The lien allows the lender to repo your automobile without a court order if you default on the loan.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reports that 20% of title loan borrowers default on this type of secured loan and lose their vehicles.
