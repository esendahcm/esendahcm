Pawnshops provide fast cash loans you secure with your property — such as cameras, electronics, guns, jewelry, and collectibles, among other valuables. You’ll need only a few minutes to obtain one of these secure loans at a pawnshop: Walk in, complete the paperwork, and collect your money and a pawn ticket.

The ticket specifies the loan due date. The pawnbroker will put your property up for sale if you don’t repay the loan before the ticket expires.

Pawnbrokers don’t check credit, so it doesn’t matter if yours is terrible. The downside of easy borrowing is that this secured loan charges an APR that can top 20% per month. A pawnshop will typically lend you between 25% and 60% of your property’s value. Despite their high costs, loans from reputable pawn shops are fast and easy to obtain.
